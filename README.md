# Walk_Run_Class

## Business Case-Study
This project is based on Human motion analysis and activity recognition using wearable watch/sensors, which help to us to classify human activities (either walking or running) based on sensor data collection from wearable devices. We will apply different Machine learning algorithm including: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XG-Boosting and Artificial Neural Network.

## Dataset Description
This Dataset consists Total of 10 Features and 1 Target(activity).

Date : The calendar date on which an activity was recorded.

Time : The specific time of day when an activity was recorded.

Username : The identifier associated with the individual wearing the wristwatch.

Wrist : Indicates the wrist (left or right) on which the wristwatch is worn.

Activity : The type of activity being performed (0 for walking/1 for running).

Acceleration_x : Acceleration along the x-axis measured by the wristwatch's accelerometer.

Acceleration_y : Acceleration along the y-axis measured by the wristwatch's accelerometer.

Acceleration_z : Acceleration along the z-axis measured by the wristwatch's accelerometer.

Gyro_x : Angular velocity around the x-axis measured by the wristwatch's gyroscope.

Gyro_y : Angular velocity around the y-axis measured by the wristwatch's gyroscope.

Gyro_z : Angular velocity around the z-axis measured by the wristwatch's gyroscope.

## Challenges faced:
We have to analyse EDA part with respect to acceleration_x, acceleration_y, acceleration_z, gyro_x, gyro_y and gyro_z and have to understand its relation with respect to wrist and activity.

For More Information Please review the full analysis in the final notebook.
